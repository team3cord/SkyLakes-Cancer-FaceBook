            <p>Some risk factors such as age, sex and family history cannot be controlled or changes. However, making healthy lifestyle choices can eliminate many of the major risk factors.</p>
            <p>Smoking tobacco is the most preventable cause of death in our society. Tobacco use is responsible for nearly 1 in 5 deaths in the United States. And it is responsible for 9 out of 10 lung cancer deaths. Staying away from all tobacco products – smokeless included – is the most important lifestyle decision you can make in regards to your health. </p>
            <p>The benefits of good nutrition, regular physical activity and staying at a healthy weight cannot be understated. Obesity is a risk factor for many types of cancers, as well as for non-cancerous diseases like diabetes. Adopting a routine for getting plenty of exercise each week will not only diminish the risk of cancer, but it will make you feel good as well. </p>
            <p>Taking steps to protect yourself from the sun can greatly reduce the chances of developing skin cancer. Some people think about sun protection only when they spend a day at the lake, beach or pool. But sun exposure adds up day after day. So be sure to wear plenty of clothing when you are out in the sun. Use a sunscreen with plenty of SPF protection, and wear a hat and sunglasses to protect the sensitive skin on your face. </p>
            <p>As cancer can sometimes result from exposure to harmful carcinogens, take the time to learn more about the environmental causes of cancer than may lurk in your home, your place of work, or within the area you live. Some medical tests and treatments may involve cancer-causing agents as well. </p>
            <p>While your family’s health history can’t be controlled, be aware of any elevated risks that history may pose. Schedule examinations and screenings accordingly. </p>
