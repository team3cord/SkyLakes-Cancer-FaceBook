       <div id="tabs-1"><p>Cancer refers to a group of more than 100 diseases in which cells in a part of the body begin to grow out of control. There are many kinds of cancer, all of which start because abnormal cells grow out of control. Untreated, cancer can result in serious illness, even death. </p>
            <p>Normal body cells grow, divide and die in an orderly fashion. It is how the body grows in the early years of life, and how the body repairs injuries and replaces worn-out or dying cells as an adult. </p>
            <p>Cancer cell growth is different. Instead of dying, cancer cells continue to grow and form new, abnormal cells, which can invade other tissues. When the DNA of a normal cell is damaged, the cell either repairs the damage or dies. A cancer cell, however, will go on making new cells that the body does not need, each with the same damaged DNA as the first cell. </p>
            <p>People can inherit damaged DNA, but most DNA damage is caused by mistakes that happen while the normal cell is reproducing or by something in our environment. Sometimes the DNA damage is from something obvious, like cigarette smoking. But often no clear cause is found.</p>
            <p>In most cases the cancer cells form a tumor. Some cancers, like leukemia, rarely form tumors. Instead, these cancer cells involve the blood and blood-forming organs and circulate through other tissues where they grow.</p>
            <p>Cancer cells often travel to other parts of the body, where they begin to grow and form new tumors that replace normal tissue – a process known as metastasis. It occurs when cancer cells get into the bloodstream, or lymph vessels of our body. </p></div>
       <div id="tabs-2">
            <p>Cancers can cause almost any sign or symptom.  The signs and symptoms will depend on where the cancer is, how big it is and how much it affects the organs and tissues. If it has metastasized, signs or symptoms may appear in different parts of the body. As cancer grows, it can begin to push on nearby organs, blood vessels and nerves. This pressure causes some of the signs and symptoms of cancer.</p>
            <p>You should know some of the general signs and symptoms of cancer. But remember, having any of these does not mean that you have cancer – many other things cause these signs and symptoms, too. If you have any of these symptoms and they last for a long time or get worse, please see a doctor to find out what is going on.</p>

            <p>Half of all men and one-third of all women in the United States will develop cancer during their lifetimes. </p>
            <p>Millions of people are living with cancer or have had cancer. The risk can be reduced by making changes to one’s lifestyle, such as quitting smoking, limiting time spent in the sun, being physically active and eating a better diet. The sooner cancer is found and treated, the better the chances for overcoming the disease and living many years. </p>
       </div>
       <div id="tabs-4">
            <p>Cancer is such a common disease that it is no surprise that many families have at least a few members who have had cancer. Sometimes, certain types of cancer seem to run in some families. This can be caused by a number of factors. Often, family members have certain risk factors in common, such as smoking, which can cause many types of cancer. But in some cases the cancer is caused by an abnormal gene that is being passed along from generation to generation. Although this is often referred to as inherited cancer, what is inherited is the abnormal gene that can lead to cancer, not the cancer itself. Only about 5-10 percent of all cancers are inherited.</p>
            <p>Tobacco use is responsible for nearly 1 in 5 deaths in the United States. And it is responsible for 9 out of 10 lung cancer deaths. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women, accounting for at least 30 percent of all cancer deaths. It is one of the hardest cancers to treat. Because cigarette smoking and tobacco use are acquired behaviors – activities that people choose to do – smoking is the most preventable cause of death in our society.</p>
            <p>Secondhand smoke can also put people at risk for lung cancer, as each year about 3,400 of lung cancer deaths come as a result of breathing secondhand smoke. </p>
            <p>The connection of cancer to obesity, lack of exercise and poor diet has been well established. Of the 570,000 Americans who die of cancer each year, a full one-third are linked to poor diet, physical inactivity and carrying too much weight. </p>
            <p>Being overweight can increase cancer risk in many ways. Excess weight causes the body to produce and circulate more of the hormones estrogen and insulin, which can stimulate cancer growth. </p>
            <p>Alcohol use has also been linked to certain types of cancer, including cancers of the mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus, liver, breast and colon.</p>
            <p>Overexposure to the sun’s harmful UV rays can lead to skin cancer. Accounting for nearly half of all cancers, skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. More than 2 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer are found in the United States each year. Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, accounts for most of the 11,790 deaths due to skin cancer each year.</p>
            <p>The environment can put people at risk, as they may be unaware of their exposure to harmful substances at home, in the workplace or in everyday circumstances. The International Agency for Research on Cancer and the US National Toxicology Program have developed extensive lists of substances and exposures that are known or suspected to cause cancer. </p>
            <p>The list can be found here: <a style="color:red; width:" href="http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/GeneralInformationaboutCarcinogens/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens">http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/GeneralInformation<br>aboutCarcinogens/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens</a></p>
            <p>Pollutants such as benzene, radon, diesel exhaust and MTBE can also affect cancer risk.</p>
            <p>Since the start of the 20th century, it has been known that certain infections play a role in cancer in animals. More recently, infection with certain viruses, bacteria, and parasites been recognized as a risk factor for several types of cancer in humans.</p>
            <p>Worldwide, infections are linked to about 15-20 percent of cancers. In the United States and other developed countries, less than 10 percent of all cancers are thought to be linked to infectious agents. </p>
            <p>Some infections may cause long-term inflammation, suppress a person's immune system, or directly affect a cell's DNA. Any of these changes may lead to a higher risk of cancer. Yet despite this elevated risk, most people with these infections never develop cancer. Typically, additional risk factors are present if cancer develops. </p>

            <p>Treatment decision tools, like the American Cancer Society’s Profiler Treatment Option Tools, can help you make an informed decision about your treatment. Using these tools, you can access the detailed analysis of your specific condition, uncover a statistical breakdown of treatment types, and pinpoint the exact topics you should discuss with your doctor.</p>
