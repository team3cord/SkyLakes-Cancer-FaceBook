            <h3>What is cancer?</h3>
            <p>Cancer is the general name for a group of more than 100 diseases in which cells in a part of the body begin to grow out of control. Although there are many kinds of cancer, they all start because abnormal cells grow out of control. Untreated cancers can cause serious illness and even death.</p>
            <h3>Normal cells in the body</h3>
            <p>The body is made up of hundreds of millions of living cells. Normal body cells grow, divide, and die in an orderly fashion. During the early years of a person's life, normal cells divide faster to allow the person to grow. After the person becomes an adult, most cells divide only to replace worn-out or dying cells or to repair injuries.</p>
            <h3>How cancer starts</h3>
            <p>Cancer starts when cells in a part of the body start to grow out of control. There are many kinds of cancer, but they all start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells.</p>
            <p>Cancer cell growth is different from normal cell growth. Instead of dying, cancer cells continue to grow and form new, abnormal cells. Cancer cells can also invade (grow into) other tissues, something that normal cells cannot do. Growing out of control and invading other tissues are what makes a cell a cancer cell.</p>
            <p>Cells become cancer cells because of damage to DNA. DNA is in every cell and directs all its actions. In a normal cell, when DNA gets damaged the cell either repairs the damage or the cell dies. In cancer cells, the damaged DNA is not repaired, but the cell doesn't die like it should. Instead, this cell goes on making new cells that the body does not need. These new cells will all have the same damaged DNA as the first cell does.</p>
            <p>People can inherit damaged DNA, but most DNA damage is caused by mistakes that happen while the normal cell is reproducing or by something in our environment. Sometimes the cause of the DNA damage is something obvious, like cigarette smoking. But often no clear cause is found.</p>
            <p>In most cases the cancer cells form a tumor. Some cancers, like leukemia, rarely form tumors. Instead, these cancer cells involve the blood and blood-forming organs and circulate through other tissues where they grow.</p>
            <h3>How cancer spreads</h3>
            <p>Cancer cells often travel to other parts of the body, where they begin to grow and form new tumors that replace normal tissue. This process is called metastasis. It happens when the cancer cells get into the bloodstream or lymph vessels of our body.</p>
            <h3>How cancers differ</h3>
            <p>No matter where a cancer may spread, it is always named for the place where it started. For example, breast cancer that has spread to the liver is still called breast cancer, not liver cancer. Likewise, prostate cancer that has spread to the bone is metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer.</p>
            <p>Different types of cancer can behave very differently. For example, lung cancer and breast cancer are very different diseases. They grow at different rates and respond to different treatments. That is why people with cancer need treatment that is aimed at their particular kind of cancer.</p>
            <h3>Tumors that are not cancer</h3>
            <p>Not all tumors are cancerous. Tumors that aren't cancer are called benign. Benign tumors can cause problems – they can grow very large and press on healthy organs and tissues. But they cannot grow into (invade) other tissues. Because they can't invade, they also can't spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). These tumors are almost never life threatening.</p>
            <h3>How common is cancer?</h3>
            <p>Half of all men and one-third of all women in the US will develop cancer during their lifetimes.</p>
            <p>Today, millions of people are living with cancer or have had cancer. The risk of developing most types of cancer can be reduced by changes in a person's lifestyle, for example, by quitting smoking, limiting time in the sun, being physically active, and eating a better diet. The sooner a cancer is found and treated, the better the chances are for living for many years.</p>
            <h1 style="color: #FF00FF">What causes cancer?</h1>
            <h3>Things people do</h3>
            <p>Some cancers are caused by things people do or expose themselves to. For example, smoking can cause cancers of the lungs, mouth, throat, bladder, kidneys, and other organs, as well as heart disease and stroke. Although not everyone who smokes gets cancer, smoking increases a person's chance of getting the disease.</p>
            <p>Being in the sun too much without protection can cause skin cancer. Melanoma is a very serious form of skin cancer that is linked to sunlight and tanning bed exposure.</p>
            <h3>Other things people are ecposed to</h3>
            <p>Radiation can cause cancer. For example, people exposed to nuclear fallout have a higher cancer risk than those who were not exposed. Rarely, radiation treatment for one type of cancer can cause another cancer to grow many years later. This is why doctors and dentists use the lowest possible doses of radiation for x-rays and scans (much lower than the doses used for cancer treatment).</p>
            <p>Certain chemicals have been linked to cancer, too. Being exposed to or working with them can increase a person's risk of having cancer. Of every 20 cases of cancer, about one is linked to genes that are inherited from parents.</p>
            <h3>Bottom line</h3>
            <p>No one knows the exact cause of most cases of cancer. We know that certain changes in our cells can cause cancer to start, but we don't yet know exactly how it all happens. Scientists are studying this problem and learning more about the many steps it takes for cancers to form and grow. Although some of the factors in these steps may be a lot alike, the process that happens in the cells is generally different for each type of cancer.</p>
            <h3>Can injuries cause cancer?</h3>
            <p>Researchers have done many studies to see if there is a link between personality, stress, and cancer. No scientific evidence has shown that a person's personality or outlook can affect their cancer risk.</p>
            <p>There are many factors to look at in the relationship between stress and cancer. It is known that stress affects the immune system, but so do many other factors. Despite many studies, a link between psychological stress and cancer has not been proven. Looking at the studies that have been done, it seems they sometimes come to opposite conclusions.</p>
            <p>In one large Danish study, people who reported major stressors in their lives did not appear to have a seriously increased risk for any type of cancer. Another study that looked at women with major life stressors, such as divorce or the death of someone close, found a slight increase (about one-third higher than average) in breast cancer compared to women without these stressors. In the area of day-to-day stress, another study showed higher breast cancer risk linked to stress. Yet another found that women reporting higher day-to-day stress actually were less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer within the next 18 years.</p>
            <p>It is hard to explain these differences. Some may be related to the groups that were studied, while others may be due to the way the study was done. Chance may have played a role, too. All that can be said for now is that a definite link between stress and cancer risk has not yet been found.</p>
            <h3>Is cancer contagious?</h3>
            <p>In the past, people often stayed away from someone who had cancer. They were afraid they might "catch" the disease. But cancer is not like the flu or a cold. You cannot catch cancer from someone who has it. You will not get cancer by being around or touching someone with cancer. Don't be afraid to visit someone with cancer. They need the support of their family and friends.</p>
            <h3>Tobacco</h3>
            <p>Many cancers might be prevented if people did not use tobacco.</p>
            <p>Smoking damages nearly every organ in the human body and accounts for some 30 percent of all cancer deaths. It is best to never use tobacco at all and to stay away from secondhand smoke. Cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and oral (smokeless) tobacco products cause cancer and should not be used. People who use tobacco should try to quit. Studies clearly show that ex-smokers have less risk of cancer than people who continue to smoke.</p>
            <h3>Drinking and smoking</h3>
            <p>The combined use of alcohol and tobacco raises the risk of mouth, throat, voice box, and esophagus cancer far more than the effects of either drinking or smoking alone.</p>
            <h3>Ultravioler (UV) rays and sunlight</h3>
            <p>You can lower your chances of getting skin cancer by:</p>
            <ul>
                  <li>Staying out of the sun between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</li>
                  <li>Wearing a hat, shirt, and sunglasses when you are in the sun</li>
                  <li>Using sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher</li>
                  <li>Not using tanning beds or lamps</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>We know that our diet (what we eat or don't eat) is linked to some types of cancer, although the exact reasons are not yet clear. The best information we have suggests a lower cancer risk for people who:</p>
            <ul>
                  <li>Eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables (at least five servings a day)</li>
                  <li>Choose whole grains rather than refined grains and sugars</li>
                  <li>Limit red meats (beef, pork, and lamb)</li>
                  <li>Limit processed meats (such as bacon, deli meats, and hot dogs)</li>
                  <li>Choose foods to help you stay at a healthy weight</li>
                  <li>Limit alcohol intake to one alcoholic drink a day or less for women and two or less for men</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Early detection</h3>
            <p>To find cancer early, while it is small and before it has spread, adults should have regular tests called screening examinations. Talk to your doctor about which screening tests might be right for you. If cancer is found early, it can be easier to treat.</p>
            <h3>How many people alive today have ever had cancer?</h3>
            <p>Today, about 11.7 million people alive in the United States have had some type of cancer. Some of these people are cancer-free; others still have the disease.</p>
            <p>Years ago, most people who had cancer did not live very long. That is not the case any more. Every year more and more people survive cancer. This is especially true of children with cancer.</p>
            <p>The survival rates are different for people with different types of cancers. Some types of cancer grow very slowly. Some respond to treatment very well. Others grow and spread faster and are harder to treat. If you know someone who has cancer, keep in mind that what happens to them could be very different from what happens to someone else with another type of cancer.</p>
            <h3>How is cancer treated?</h3>
            <p>Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are the three main types of cancer treatment. A person with cancer may have any or all of these treatments.</p>
            <h3>Surgery</h3>
            <p>Surgery is often the first treatment option if the cancer is a tumor that can be removed from the body. Sometimes only part of the cancer can be removed. Radiation or chemotherapy might be used to shrink the cancer before or after surgery.</p>
            <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
            <p>Doctors use chemotherapy or "chemo" drugs to kill cancer cells. Usually, the drugs are given intravenously (IV, or into a vein) or taken by mouth. Chemo drugs then travel throughout the body in the bloodstream. They can reach cancer cells that may have metastasized (spread) from the tumor.</p>
            <h3>Radiation therapy</h3>
            <p>Radiation therapy is treatment with high-energy rays (such as x-rays) to kill or shrink cancer cells. The radiation may come from outside the body, called external radiation, or from radioactive materials placed right into the tumor (internal or implant radiation). Getting external radiation is similar to getting an x-ray. It is painless, but it can cause side-effects.</p>
            <h3>Other types of cancer treatment</h3>
            <p>Other kinds of treatment you might hear about include hormone therapy, stem cell or bone marrow transplant, and immunotherapy. Hormone therapy is sometimes used to treat certain kinds of prostate and breast cancers. Immunotherapy is treatment designed to boost the cancer patient's own immune system to help fight the cancer. If you'd like more information on these treatments, see the section called "To learn more."</p>
            <h3>What are the side effects of cancer treatment?</h3>
            <p>The type of treatment a person gets depends on the type and stage (extent) of the cancer, the age of the patient, and his or her medical history and general health. Each drug or treatment plan has different side effects. It is hard to predict what side effects a patient will have, even if patients get the same treatment. Some effects can be severe and others fairly mild. It is true that some people have a tough time with cancer treatment, but many others manage quite well throughout treatment.</p>
            <h3>Chemo side effects</h3>
            <p>Short-term (and often treatable) side effects of chemo can include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, hair loss, and mouth sores. Because chemo can damage the blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, patients may have low blood cell counts. This can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                  <li>Higher risk of infection (from a shortage of white blood cells)</li>
                  <li>Bleeding or bruising after minor cuts or injuries (from a shortage of blood platelets)</li>
                  <li>Anemia (from low red blood cell counts), which can cause tiredness, shortness of breath, pale skin, and other symptoms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cancer care teams must work carefully with the patient to manage the side effects of chemo.</p>
            <p>Everyone will respond differently to chemo. Most of the side effects of chemo go away after treatment ends. For example, hair lost during treatment grows back after treatment is over. In the meantime, most patients are able to use wigs, scarves, or hats to cover, warm, or protect their heads.</p>
            <h3>Radiation side effects</h3>
            <p>Radiation treatments are much like x-rays and do not cause any pain. The most common side effects are skin irritation and fatigue. Fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness and low energy. It is especially common when treatments go on for many weeks. Fatigue often does not get better with rest. Other side effects can happen, too, depending on what part of the body is being treated.</p>
            <h3>Is cancer treatment worse than cancer?</h3>
            <p>This is a belief that can be dangerous to some people. Those who think this is true might not get treatment that can save their lives.</p>
            <p>It is easy to understand one of the sources of this belief. Often people diagnosed with cancer have never had any symptoms or pain, or any problems they've had have been fairly small. In the early stages of cancer, symptoms tend to be minor, if there are any at all. It is only after the treatment starts that people start to feel sick. It is also true that chemo, radiation, and surgery can cause distressing symptoms. But the side effects fade after the treatment is over, and the treatment can be life-saving</p>
            <p>Sometimes a person in very poor health may not be able to take cancer treatment. Or because of age and other medical conditions, a person might decide not to be treated for cancer, even knowing that it will cause death. A person in this situation may determine that cancer treatment will not offer a chance for cure, and will not be worth the time it will take or the side effects it will cause. This is every person's choice, as long as the person is a competent adult who is able to handle his or her affairs.</p>
            <p>The person who is thinking of refusing treatment must clearly understand the likely outcomes of both treatment and non-treatment before making a decision to refuse treatment. Later in the course of cancer, when more serious symptoms start, curative treatment may no longer be an option. Cancer kills by invading the intestines, lungs, brain, liver, kidneys, or other vital organs, or by interfering with a body function that is necessary for life. Untreated cancer commonly causes death.</p>
            <p>In contrast, cancer treatment is usually fairly short term and can save lives. Even when it cannot cure, treatment can often prolong life. And medical care can always be used to make a person more comfortable by reducing pain and other symptoms caused by the cancer or its treatment.</p>
            <p>There are times when every cancer patient questions their commitment to the difficult journey of treatment and its side effects. Sometimes they can get discouraged by the uncertainty of treatment and wonder if it's worth it. This is normal. It may help to know that doctors are always learning better ways to work with patients to control treatment side effects. And remember each year brings advances in cancer treatments.</p>

       <div id="tabs-2">
            <p>Brachytherapy – An internal treatment procedure that involves implanting radioactive sources (isotopes) in or very near the target tumor. Dr. Kramer is skilled in placing brachytherapy treatment “seeds.”</p>
            <p>Cancer – An abnormal malignant growth of cells that invade nearby tissues and often spread to other sites in the body, interfering with the normal function of the affected sites.</p>
            <p>Chemotherapy – Treatment of disease by chemical agents. Anticancer drugs generally inhibit the proliferation of cells. Medical oncologists such as Dr. Fang prescribe chemotherapy, cell regulating therapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy when warranted.</p>
            <p>CT Scanner – Sort of a circular x-ray machine, the scanner’s images are reconstructed in a computer that provides a visualization of tissue, bones and tumors. The scans are used to not only detect tumors, but also to help plan and carry out treatment. There is a dedicated CT Scanner on site at the Sky Lakes Cancer Treatment Center.</p>
            <p>IMRT -- Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. Computers automatically adjust the strength and the shape of the radiation beam along with shielding devices inside the device to deliver radiation more precisely to the tumor while relatively sparing surrounding normal tissues.</p>
            <p>IGRT – Image Guided Radiation Therapy, used with IMRT, provides your physician increased certainty that the radiation is hitting the intended target while missing normal tissues. The Sky Lakes Cancer Treatment Center radiation oncology Department uses both IMRT and IGRT to help patients.</p>
            <p>Metastasis – Spread of a tumor from its site of origin to distant sites, usually through the bloodstream, the lymphatic system, or across a cavity. (Verb, metastasize)</p>
            <p>Radiation Therapy – Also called radiotherapy. Treatment of certain forms of cancer and some benign conditions by radiation produced by special machines called linear accelerators or by radioactive isotopes. The radiation interferes with the division of cells and the synthesis of DNA.</p>
            <p>Tumor – Growth of tissue characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation. A tumor may be benign or malignant; localized or invasive. Also called neoplasm.</p>
